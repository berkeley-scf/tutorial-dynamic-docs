Tutorial on creating dynamic documents, focused on R

This tutorial covers:

* Embedding R and bash and Python code in Markdown using R Markdown and Quarto Markdown (qmd).
* Embedding R and bash (and Python) code in Latex using knitr (and Sweave).
* Embedding R and bash (and Python) code in the LyX GUI for Latex using knitr and Sweave.
* A bit on Jupyter Notebooks, focused on use via Quarto.

It also illustrates some work-arounds to the common problem of lines of code or code output running off the right side of the page.
