# tutorial-dynamic-docs
Tutorial on creating dynamic documents, focused on Quarto.

This tutorial covers:

* Embedding code chunks (Python, R, bash) in Quarto Markdown (qmd).
* Embedding R and bash and Python code in Markdown using R Markdown.
* Embedding R and bash and Python code in LaTeX using knitr (and Sweave).
* Embedding R and bash and Python code in the LyX GUI for LaTeX using knitr and Sweave.
* A bit on Jupyter Notebooks.

It also illustrates some work-arounds to the common problem of lines of code or code output running off the right side of the page.

Included in this repository are template documents for the various modalities described above.
